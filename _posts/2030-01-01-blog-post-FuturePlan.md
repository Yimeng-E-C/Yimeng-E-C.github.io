### **As Leader**  
### **Based on**：

### **Abstract**: 
For my future research, I propose to pioneer an aerial robotic swarm system for next-generation unmanned delivery and low-altitude economy, integrating bio-mimetic grippers with arthropod-inspired adaptive compliance to ensure secure cargo manipulation on irregular surfaces, distributed reinforcement learning-based swarm control for cooperative multi-agent trajectory planning in congested airspace, and multi-dimensional perception (fusing vision, UWB and LiDAR) to achieve precise target localization and end-to-end delivery autonomy under GPS-denied conditions. This research directly extends your lab’s pioneering work in reinforcement learning-driven robotics control and robust environmental perception, with transformative applications in urban logistics and emergency response operations.
