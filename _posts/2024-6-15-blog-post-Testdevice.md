### **As Research Member**  2024.3 - 2024.6
### **Based on**ï¼š
internship at Chinese Academy of Agricultural Mechanization Sciences
### **Abstract**: 
The dry matter content of potatoes is an important indicator of the nutritional composition of potatoes, and the level of dry matter content directly affects the energy consumption during processing. The wide variation in the quality of raw materials used in potato processing and the lack of low-cost, rapid means of testing the quality of raw materials make processing difficult and the quality of processed products unstable. To meet the needs of potato quality sampling, this study carries out research on optical non-destructive testing techniques and handheld equipment for dry matter potatoes, and carries out physical verification.
### **Project Output**:
1. Hardware development of a handheld potato dry matter non-destructive testing device.
2. Development and optimization of a regression prediction model for the dry matter content of potatoes.
3. Development of handheld potato dry matter non-destructive testing software.
4. Experimental validation of the hand-held potato dry matter non-destructive testing device.

### **Contribution**:
1. Handheld device structure and circuit optimization
2. Appearance design and ergonomic design
