### **As Leader**  2024.3 - 2024.8
### **Abstract**: 
Pet mental health is increasingly recognized as a crucial aspect of overall pet well-being and a key determinant of the quality of life for both pets and their owners (pet-owner interaction). Recent societal initiatives and regulations highlight the growing importance of addressing pet emotional needs. Studies indicate that advanced technologies, such as wearable devices and machine learning, hold significant potential for real-time monitoring and enhancement of pet mental health. This research offers a powerful approach to anticipate future possibilities by visualizing detailed information through wearable product and UX/UI design. We present a set of design research methods engaging pet owners in various empathy activities and a design process to translate their needs into visual concepts for future pet mental health monitoring devices that are user-friendly and more likely to be adopted.
### **Contribution**:
1. Literature review on animal emotion, animal behavior.
2. Field study: questionnair, interview
3. Industrial design, product development
4. Prototyping, Control system programing, prototype verification
